# Healthcare_Data_Analysis

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing patient appointments, payments, and doctor efficiency using SQL and data visualization tools. The analysis covers data cleaning, patient insights, appointment trends, and payment insights, along with advanced analytics.

# 1. Data Overview & Cleaning

# 1.1 Check Data Completeness

- Identify missing values in patients, doctors, appointments, and payments tables.

- Detect duplicate records and remove or handle them appropriately.

# 1.2 Summarize the Data

- Calculate the total counts of:

        - Patients

        - Doctors

        - Appointments

        - Payments

- Extract unique specialties in the doctors table.

# 2. Patient & Appointment Insights

# 2.1 Find the Most Common Appointment Status

- Count how many appointments are Scheduled, Completed, or Cancelled.

# 2.2 Identify the Busiest Doctor

- Determine which doctor has the highest number of appointments.

# 2.3 Analyze Appointment Trends Over Time

- Identify peak months and days for appointments.

# 2.4 Find Average Waiting Time

- Calculate the time difference between appointment booking date and actual appointment date.

# 2.5 Determine No-Show Rates

- Count how many patients have Cancelled or Missed appointments.

# 3. Payment Insights

# 3.1 Analyze Payment Methods

- Identify the most frequently used payment method (Cash, Credit Card, Insurance, Online).

# 3.2 Find the Total Revenue

- Compute total earnings from Completed appointments.

# 3.3 Identify Unpaid Appointments

- Detect appointments where the payment status is Pending.

# 3.4 Detect Refund Patterns

- Count the number of Refunded payments and analyze possible reasons.

# 4. Advanced Insights

# 4.1 Find High-Value Patients

- Identify patients who have made the most payments.

# 4.2 Doctor Efficiency Analysis

- Compare the number of total appointments per doctor vs. completed appointments.

# 4.3 Predict Appointment Cancellations

- Analyze trends in cancellations based on time of day, doctor, or patient demographics.

# 4.4 Find Common Health Issues

- Extract the most common appointment reasons from appointment notes (if available).

# 5. Visualization Tasks (Using Python/BI Tools)

# 5.1 Create a Line Chart of Appointment Trends

- Show how appointments vary by month.

# 5.2 Generate a Bar Chart of Revenue by Payment Method

- Compare earnings from different payment methods.

# 5.3 Visualize Doctor Workload

- Show appointments per doctor using a bar chart.

# 5.4 Map Patient Locations

- Plot patient distribution based on their addresses.

# 5.5 Analyze Patient Demographics

- Visualize gender and age group distributions.

# Technologies Used

- SQL for data extraction and analysis

- Python / Power BI / Tableau for data visualization

- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation (if using Python)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn for charting (if using Python)

# How to Use

- Run SQL queries to extract and clean the data.

- Perform data analysis following the insights listed above.

- Use visualization tools to generate meaningful charts.

- Interpret findings and take action based on insights.

# Future Improvements

- Integrate Machine Learning to predict patient no-shows.

- Automate dashboard updates for real-time insights.

- Expand analysis to include patient feedback and satisfaction levels.
